# Documentation on the debugging process involved when testing my counter react app

After installing the chrome browser extension version of the react-devtools, I opened the debugging environment after running the app. In the debugging environment, I viewed the component tree hierachy after clicking the component tab, which enabled me to see all the state variables, hooks and props I implemented when designing the app.

Through the debugger, I saw the correct state values, and props which matched what was expected since I encountered to error when running the app.

The app behavior was in line with what was expected and designed, and each components worked well without any issues.
